Risk code notes

RiskAllocator.cs 72: ReallocateRisk(CandidateType, List<ChainAllocation, hasServingSuggestion, removeIfZero) 
106: foreach risky chain (except best chain) in list
allowed risk per chain = allowed placement risk * chain allocation
112: the risk allowed for this change equals the total risk times this chain's allocation
113: max impressions allowed per risky chain:
	RiskUtilities 18: Max(0, (riskAmount * 1000 / (double)(clientFloorPrice - komoonaFloorPriceAfterCommission)));
	= $ total risk amount allowed for this chain / $ risk per impression = risk impressions allowed
114: max allocation = max impressions per risky chain / placement avg daily impressions
115: if chain allocation exceeds max allocation {
116: 	if max is less than type's minimum 
			remove chain
		else
			reduce allocation to max
			remainder = accumulation of the freed percents
139: end foreach

141: if remainder >0 and there are non-risky chains
154: take all non-risky chains with serving suggestion (best chain that wasn't chosen doesn't have an s.s.)
162: calculate a serving suggestion (by goal) on a copy set of original chains 
168-174: add to the original suggestion the amount that was calculated on the copy.

if remainder was distributed, return 0, if not, return remainder
